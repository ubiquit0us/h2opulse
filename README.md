This repository contains the code and models used in our research on non-invasive dehydration detection using hand vein images captured with an infrared (IR) camera. The study focuses on extracting key regions of interest (ROI) from vein images and utilizing a multi-modal Siamese model for hydration status classification.

## ROI Extraction Using Segmentation Model
For extracting the ROI using the segmentation model, we needed to mask the dataset. To achieve this, we used [CVAT](https://cvat.ai/) for annotation and dataset preparation.
